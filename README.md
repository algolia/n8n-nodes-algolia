# n8n-nodes-algolia

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use Algolia in your n8n workflows.

Algolia is a hosted search API that provides search-as-a-service solutions. It offers powerful search capabilities including full-text search, faceting, geo-search, and instant search with typo tolerance.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

### Api Keys

- **List API keys** - Lists all API keys associated with your Algolia application, including their permissions and restrictions.
- **Create an API key** - Creates a new API key with specific permissions and restrictions.
- **Retrieve API key permissions** - Gets the permissions and restrictions of an API key.
- **Update an API key** - Replaces the permissions of an existing API key.
- **Delete an API key** - Deletes the API key.
- **Restore an API key** - Restores a deleted API key.

### Clusters

- **Delete user ID** - Deletes a user ID and its associated data from the clusters.
- **List clusters** - Lists the available clusters in a multi-cluster setup.
- **Search for user IDs** - Since it can take a few seconds to get the data from the different clusters,
