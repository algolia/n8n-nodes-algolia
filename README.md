# n8n-nodes-algolia

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use Algolia in your n8n workflows.

Algolia is a hosted search API that provides search-as-a-service solutions. It offers powerful search capabilities including full-text search, faceting, geo-search, and instant search with typo tolerance.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

- **Get logs** - The request must be authenticated by an API key with the [`logs` ACL](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/#access-control-list-acl).
- **Get app task** - Checks the status of a given application task.

### Api Keys
- **List api keys** - Lists all API keys associated with your Algolia application, including their permissions and restrictions.
- **Add api key** - Creates a new API key with specific permissions and restrictions.
- **Get api key** - Gets the permissions and restrictions of an API key.
- **Update api key** - Replaces the permissions of an existing API key.
- **Delete api key** - Deletes the API key.
- **Restore api key** - Restores a deleted API key.

### Clusters
- **Assign user id** - Assigns or moves a user ID to a cluster.
- **List user ids** - Lists the userIDs assigned to a multi-cluster application.
- **Batch assign user ids** - Assigns multiple user IDs to a cluster.
- **Get top user ids** - Get the IDs of the 10 users with the highest number of records per cluster.
- **Get user id** - Returns the user ID data stored in the mapping.
- **Remove user id** - Deletes a user ID and its associated data from the clusters.
- **List clusters** - Lists the available clusters in a multi-cluster setup.
- **Search user ids** - Since it can take a few seconds to get the data from the different clusters,
- **Has pending mappings** - To determine when the time-consuming process of creating a large batch of users or migrating users from one cluster to another is complete, this operation retrieves the status of the process.

- **List indices** - Lists all indices in the current Algolia application.

### Records
- **Save object** - Adds a record to an index or replaces it.
- **Get object** - Retrieves one record by its object ID.
